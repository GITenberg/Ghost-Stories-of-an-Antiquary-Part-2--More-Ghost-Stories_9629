description: "More Ghost Stories is the title of M. R. James's second collection of\
  \ ghost stories, published in 1911. Some later editions under the title Ghost Stories\
  \ of an Antiquary contain it and the earlier Ghost Stories of an Antiquary in one\
  \ volume.\nMontague Rhodes James (1862â€“1936) was a medievalist scholar; Provost\
  \ of King's College, Cambridge. He wrote many of his ghost stories to be read aloud\
  \ in the long tradition of spooky Christmas Eve tales. His stories often use rural\
  \ settings, with a quiet, scholarly protagonist getting caught up in the activities\
  \ of supernatural forces. The details of horror are almost never explicit, the stories\
  \ relying on a gentle, bucolic background to emphasise the awfulness of the otherworldly\
  \ intrusions.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
